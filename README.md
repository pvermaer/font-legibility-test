# Font legibility test

This is a little tool to test the legibility of different fonts for typical aviation data like flight numbers, aircraft types and gate numbers using Fraport API to use actual flight data.

You can check the [demo](https://vrmrck.be/projects/legibility/) and an article with background story on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pvermaer/down-the-font-legibility-rabbit-hole-481f207a6013).
